                        <p>I and my college friends got an opportunity to travel to Arizona recently. We packed our bags and left to Mumbai to take our flights early in the morning around 4 a.m. On reaching Arizona, we immediately travelled to our hotel rooms. We got changed into our travel outfits and set out on an adventure. Our first destination was Grand Canyon National Park.</p>
                        <p>We had a chance to take a helicopter ride at the Grand Canyon National Park and were totally awestruck by the views of the Smoky mountains and the beatuiful valleys. We decided to have a quick stop to have our breakfast in a nearby restaurant and had eggs and a cup of coffee.</p>
